CS683-MIPS-Simulator
====================

6 Stage MIPS Simulator in Java

Problem: Simulation of MIPS ISA

Statement:

Develop a program to simulate MIPS instruction set architecture (32 bit) which implements SIX stage pipelines which are namely: Instruction fetch (IF), Instruction decode (ID), Register read (RR), Execution (EX), Memory reference (MEM), Write back (WB). Your simulation program should execute the instructions and evaluate the performance. Evaluate the performance in the presence and absence of data forwarding mechanism.
